Note writer TODO:
1.Make notes hierarchical - add parent ID input to specify note parent.
2.Use . delimiter create ID based on this hierarchy.  E.g. MCR.PMT.OP.Psych.PHP
3.Add validation to check ID uniqueness
4.Add ability to open up parent/sibling/child notes for editing.  Maybe also enter existing ID to open existing note.
5. When quit hotkey is used, program exits as expected but throws errors.  Clean up.
6. Make UI a little nicer - improve colors.
