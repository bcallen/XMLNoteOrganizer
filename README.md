# XMLNoteOrganizer

##Purpose / Intended use
The XML Note Organizer is a simple tool developed for my personal use for creating and reviewing organized, hierarchical notes.  The interface is intended to be opened briefly, a short note written and saved, and closed again to promote regular documentation of work/study/other topics. Brief notes with the proper tags can be quickly and easily browsed, searched and reviewed using the notes reader. Note trees can later be converted to block text form as a starting point for formal documentation.

##Components
For version 1.0 there will be three components:
- *Note writer* local application for efficiently taking/editing notes in XML
- *Note reader* browser application for efficiently browsing/searching/reading previously written notes.
- *Doc generator* for formatting all/some of the notes into memo format as a starting point for later, formal documentation.

It is possible that these components will be merged or otherwise consolidated in future versions.
