# XMLNoteOrganizer

##Purpose / Intended use
The XML Note Organizer is a simple tool developed for my personal use for writing organized, hierarchical notes.  The interface is intended to be opened briefly, a brief note written and saved, and closed again to promote brief, regular documentation of work/study/other topics. Brief notes with the proper tags can be quickly and easily browsed, searched and reviewed using the notes reader. Note trees can be converted to text form as a starting point for formal documentation.

##Components
Initially, there will be three components:
- *Note writer* local application for efficiently taking/editing notes in XML
- *Note reader* browser application for efficiently browsing/searching/reading previously written notes.
- *Doc generator* for formatting all/some of the notes into memo format as a starting point for later, formal documentation.
